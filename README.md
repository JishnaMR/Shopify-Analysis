### KPI’s Requirements

### 1. Transactions Performance:
This section focuses on evaluating the overall health and effectiveness of sales operations by tracking:

1.1. Net Sales : Total revenue generated before tax.
                      Following DAX expression was written to find Net sale:

                          Net Sales = SUM(shopify_data[Subtotal Price])
                           
1.2. Total Quantity : The cumulative number of products sold.
                      Following DAX expression was written to find Total Quantity:

                        Total Quantity = SUM(shopify_data[Quantity])
1.3. Net Avg Order Value: The average revenue per transaction, excluding tax.
                           Following DAX expression was written to find Net sale:

                        Net Avg Order Value = AVERAGE(shopify_data[Subtotal Price])
2.Customer Purchase Behavior

Understanding how customers interact with the business is critical.
    2.1. Total Customers: The count of unique buyers.
                         Following DAX expression was written to find Total Customers:

                    Total Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(shopify_data[customer Id])
   
   2.2. Single Order Customers: Customers who placed only one order.
                               Following DAX expression was written to find Single Order Customers:

                     Single Order Customers = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(VALUES(shopify_data[Customer Id])),
                            FILTER(VALUES(shopify_data[Customer Id]),
                                     CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(shopify_data[order Number])) = 1
                            ))

   2.3. Repeat Customers: Customers with more than one order, indicating loyalty.
                        Following DAX expression was written to find Repeat Customers:

                         
                     Repeat Customers = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(VALUES(shopify_data[Customer Id])),
                                        FILTER(VALUES(shopify_data[Customer Id]),
                                                CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(shopify_data[order Number])) > 1
                                        ))

3. Retention & Value KPIs 
     
To evaluate long-term growth and customer value, this section includes:
        3.1. Lifetime Value (LTV): The total revenue generated by a customer over time.
                                  Following DAX expression was written to find Lifetime Value (LTV):

                      Life Time Values = [Net Sales] / [Total Customers]

  3.2. Repeat Rate: The percentage of customers who return to make another purchase.
                     Following DAX expression was written to find Repeat Rate:

                      Repeat Rate = [Repeat Customers] / [Total Customers]

  3.3. Purchase Frequency: How often customers place orders, on average.
                            Following DAX expression was written to find Purchase Frequency:

                     Purchase Frequency = DISTINCTCOUNT(shopify_data[order number]) / [Total Customers]


### Charts Requirements

This section will support dynamic analysis using a measure selector for: Net Sales, Total Quantity, Total Customers, Repeat Customers

1. Regional Overview - Province and Cities
   
  1.1.  Filled Map (Province-Level):
           
  Purpose: Display province-wise performance using color saturation based on the selected measure.

  Interactivity: Changes dynamically with the measure selector.

  1.2. Bubble Map / Density Map (City Level):

  Purpose: Visually represent sales or customer density at a more granular level.

  Bubble Size or Heat Intensity: Driven by the selected measure.

  Tooltip: Shows all key metrics (Net Sales, Quantity, Total Customers, Repeat Customers).

   1.3. Bar Chart (City-Level Performance):

  Purpose : Compare top-performing cities based on the selected KPI.
  
  Sorted  : Descending order by selected measure.
  
  Dynamic : Interacts with slicers/filters and responds to the KPI selector.

2. Sales Trend Over Time

   2.1. Area Chart – Trend by Day

   Purpose: Show the daily trend of the selected measure (e.g., daily Net Sales or daily Repeat Customers).

   Interactivity: Changes dynamically based on the selected measure.

   2.2. Bar Chart or Line Chart – Trend by Hour

   Purpose: Display sales or customer activity by hour of the day (e.g., 0–23 hrs), revealing peak activity periods.

   Use Case: Helps understand time-of-day behavior, useful for marketing or operational timing decisions.

3. Gateway Payment Method

   -> Identify the most and least used payment methods.

   -> Detect customer preferences across regions or campaigns.

4. Product Type

   ->Determine which product types generate the highest revenue and order volume.

   ->Understand how customer engagement varies across different product categories.


Charts Requirements:

->Provide a dedicated page to display transaction-level or detailed data.

-> Allow users to drill through from summary visuals (like charts and KPIs) to see underlying records.

-> Enable users to explore data at a granular level, such as individual orders, customers, or product types.

-> Help explain summary trends and validate aggregated metrics with raw data.
