### KPIâ€™s Requirements

1. Transactions Performance:
This section focuses on evaluating the overall health and effectiveness of sales operations by tracking:

    1.1. Net Sales : Total revenue generated before tax.
                      Following DAX expression was written to find Net sale:

                          Net Sales = SUM(shopify_data[Subtotal Price])
                           
   1.2. Total Quantity : The cumulative number of products sold.
                      Following DAX expression was written to find Total Quantity:

                        Total Quantity = SUM(shopify_data[Quantity])
   1.3. Net Avg Order Value: The average revenue per transaction, excluding tax.
                           Following DAX expression was written to find Net sale:

                        Net Avg Order Value = AVERAGE(shopify_data[Subtotal Price])
2.Customer Purchase Behavior

Understanding how customers interact with the business is critical.
    2.1. Total Customers: The count of unique buyers.
                         Following DAX expression was written to find Total Customers:

                         Total Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(shopify_data[customer Id])
   
     2.2. Single Order Customers: Customers who placed only one order.
                               Following DAX expression was written to find Single Order Customers:

                               Single Order Customers = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(VALUES(shopify_data[Customer Id])),
                                   FILTER(VALUES(shopify_data[Customer Id]),
                                       CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(shopify_data[order Number])) = 1
                                   ))

      2.3. Repeat Customers: Customers with more than one order, indicating loyalty.
                        Following DAX expression was written to find Repeat Customers:

                         
                             Repeat Customers = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(VALUES(shopify_data[Customer Id])),
                                                   FILTER(VALUES(shopify_data[Customer Id]),
                                                       CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(shopify_data[order Number])) > 1
                                                    ))

3. Retention & Value KPIs

                                  Following DAX expression was written to find Lifetime Value (LTV):

                                  Life Time Values = [Net Sales] / [Total Customers]

  3.2. Repeat Rate: The percentage of customers who return to make another purchase.
                     Following DAX expression was written to find Repeat Rate:

                       Repeat Rate = [Repeat Customers] / [Total Customers]

  3.3. Purchase Frequency: How often customers place orders, on average.
                            Following DAX expression was written to find Purchase Frequency:

                            Purchase Frequency = DISTINCTCOUNT(shopify_data[order number]) / [Total Customers]
